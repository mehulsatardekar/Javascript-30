         <div class="text-information">
             <textarea placeholder="type here" id="text-info-adder" cols="80" rows="10"></textarea>
         </div>
         <div class="group">
          <button id="adder_cnt">Add content</button>
         </div>
        <div class="output-text">
            <span id="text-op">text will be get added here</span>

        <kbd>Note : debouncing is a concept suppose you have cart option into that cart you have button
            so what if user tries to click that button or it happen that button get clicked multiple time
            so would you charge the user for single item twice? .. debouncing would be useful in performance
            technique suppose where you have page and you have function that logs an every time you scroll it 
            prints your x-axis this could be performance killer so thats why we use debouncing.
            Here in this example on press button after 5sec it reflect changes so even if user try to add more
            text it will reflect after 5 sec. it could be useful where we have to design searchbar and there 
            using api with the debouncing we can limit the hits of api.
